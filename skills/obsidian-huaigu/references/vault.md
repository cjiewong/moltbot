# Obsidian vault: obsidian_huaigu

- Vault root: `~/obsidian/obsidian_huaigu`
- Primary content folders (current):
  - `00-Diary/`
  - `10-Trading/`
  - `20-Coding/`
  - `30-AI Learning/`
  - `40-Life/`
  - `90-Others/`
- Obsidian config (do not edit unless asked): `.obsidian/`

## Safety / housekeeping rules

- Prefer **read/search/summarize** over edits.
- **Always `git pull --rebase` before reading/searching** so results match the latest vault.
- After any edit, **commit + push** (see skill scripts) so the vault stays synced.
- If a pull/rebase causes conflicts, **stop and ask the user** how to resolve.
- Before any bulk edit/rename/move: show a plan + sample diff list and ask for approval.
- Avoid touching `.obsidian/`, `.git/`, `.claude/` unless explicitly requested.
