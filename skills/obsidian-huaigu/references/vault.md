# Obsidian vault: obsidian_huaigu

- Vault root: `~/obsidian/obsidian_huaigu`

## Primary content folders (current)

This vault currently follows a PARA-style layout:

- `00-Inbox/`
- `01-Projects/`
- `02-Areas/`
- `03-Resources/`
- `04-Atlas/`
- `05-Archive/`
- `90-Templates/`
- `99-System/`

Common resource subfolders (examples):

- `03-Resources/Clippings/` (web clips / 知乎摘录)
- `03-Resources/Coding-References/`
- `03-Resources/trading-references/`
- `03-Resources/Trading-Strategies/`

- Obsidian config (do not edit unless asked): `.obsidian/`

## Safety / housekeeping rules

- Prefer **read/search/summarize** over edits.
- **Always `git pull --rebase` before reading/searching** so results match the latest vault.
- After any edit, **commit + push** (see skill scripts) so the vault stays synced.
- If a pull/rebase causes conflicts, **stop and ask the user** how to resolve.
- Before any bulk edit/rename/move: show a plan + sample diff list and ask for approval.
- Avoid touching `.obsidian/`, `.git/`, `.claude/` unless explicitly requested.
